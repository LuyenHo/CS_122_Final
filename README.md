# Project Description

```
Our project is about wildfire forest. We will gather the information from the internet and then analyze and visualize it in a way that users can easily follow.
The interface will be able to obtain data on the wildfire in San Jose over the past 10 years. Users can find where and when it happened. Then they can plot a map of it...

```


## Interface

```
The project has a main page that shows the image of the wildfire map
It also has a popup window that shows the acres burned map, and users can interact with it
The popup window shows the counties affected and the popup window that shows the acres burned by year
```

## Data Collection and Storage
```
We use the request module to pull the contents of the image from the internet, then save it to the file and display it again in our web interface
We also use the data from a CVS file that is stored in a local machine
```

## Data Analysis and Visualization
```
We use the pande module to read data from the local machine and then analyze their data
We use the Matplotlib library to make plots for the Data Visualization
